### Data Driven Approach: Reducing Delivery Delays in E-commerce Shipping. <br>

In this data science project, a multinational e-commerce company sought to address a 59.7% delay in product deliveries, aiming to enhance on-time delivery from 40.3% to 72.46%. I applied linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, and classification tree methods in SAS Enterprise Miner 9.4 to analyze factors influencing delivery times. Insights revealed that discounts below 10.5% positively impact on-time deliveries, while products exceeding 4.12kg tend to arrive promptly. Recommendations include revising discount strategies and collaborating with reliable delivery providers. Successful implementation of these algorithms underscores the value of data mining, enabling the company to refine shipping procedures, elevate customer satisfaction, and bolster market competitiveness. <br>

In this project, a diabetes dataset was meticulously processed and analyzed using Python's pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Following data scaling with sklearn's StandardScaler, logistic regression models were implemented both manually and with sklearn. The scratch-built model, trained over 2000 iterations, exhibited a slightly superior fit to the data compared to the sklearn model, as evidenced by a higher R-square value (0.108 vs. -0.122). The manual model's learning process was comprehensively monitored through periodically displayed cost iterations. This project not only demonstrates the stepwise development, scaling, and evaluation of logistic regression models for diabetes prediction but also underscores the nuanced advantages of a carefully crafted manual implementation, providing valuable insights for future model enhancements and data-driven decision-making in the context of healthcare analytics. <br>

The rise of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, has revolutionized the financial landscape, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional banking systems. By offering a decentralized alternative to centralized banking institutions, cryptocurrencies have disrupted the traditional financial sector. Some of the most well-known cryptocurrencies have drawn a lot of investors and observers to the sector. I conducted a comprehensive analysis on forecasting DOGE cryptocurrency prices using ARIMA models. Focusing on the period from November 2017 to March 2023, we sourced data from Yahoo! Finance and applied rigorous methodology, including exploratory data analysis, stationarity tests, and model selection based on ACF and PACF analysis. Our literature review underscored the suitability of ARIMA models for cryptocurrency forecasting, drawing parallels with studies on Bitcoin. Three ARIMA models were tested, with ARIMA(5,1,5) emerging as the most effective. The comparison of actual and predicted prices revealed a 4.6% mean absolute percentage error, indicating the model's reliability.
